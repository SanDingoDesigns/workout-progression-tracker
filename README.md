## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Add exercises using the sidebar’s “+ New Exercise” button.  
2. Choose between *Timed* or *Weighted* types.  
3. Configure your sets, rest times, and targets in **Settings**.  
4. Start sessions to log performance and auto-progress.  
5. Charts and dashboards update instantly.

Your progress is stored locally in your browser, so refreshing or closing the tab won’t lose your data.
